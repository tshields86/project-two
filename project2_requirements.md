# Project 2 specs

1. APIs:
  - Must use at least one API.
  - API must be reasonably complex. OMDB API for example is not complex enough.
  - You may use an API we have used in class, but we will work with you to make the project more complex.

2. Must use Handlebars templating.

3. Must use a form.

4. Must include a README in the root directory of the project.  

5. Ask for permission if you're going to use any libraries other than jQuery and Handlebars, including CSS libraries.

6. Push to GH Pages. Please ask us if you need any help with this on Monday morning.

7. Styling is nice, but save it for the end. We want you to focus on the logic part of your app. You can always style these at the end of the course before you put them in your portfolio.

**Planning**: For this project you will definitely spend more time planning & researching your API before you ever start coding. Take time to sketch out how a user will use your website.

**Ideas**: Send us ideas for approval via Slack.

**One-on-ones**: These are mandatory. Because this project is more open ended than the game project, we'll work with you to flesh out what it means for your project to be "complete".

**Repos**: Projects should be in new repos, **not** in the al-kwharizmi repo.

**Commits**: You should commit & push every 15 minutes, but at a minimum twice a day.

**Presentations**: On Monday you will have 10 minutes to present to the class.
