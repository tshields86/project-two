General Assembly Web Development Immersive API Project


Hi,

This website incorporates two separate APIs, the first is Musixmatch API, which is used to obtain information on the users input of an artist and a track, and the second is Yodaspeak API which is used to translate language into that which Yoda would use.

TrackID, Artist name, Track name, Album name, and Album cover art is taken from Musixmatch JSONP result and after using the TrackID in a second AJAX call, the Lyrics are returned which are then modified to input into the Yodaspeak API.

Enjoy!
